    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="aboutMeText">I am currently in my fourth year at the University of Michigan, and I will be graduating in Fall 2025. I declared an English major in Fall 2023, and declared Computer
    Science as a double major in Fall 2024. I had my first coding experience when I enrolled in EECS 183, Elementary Programming, in Winter 2024 after completing the
    requirements for my English major. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and felt motivated to pursue Computer Science alongside my existing English major. While
    taking EECS 183, I had the opportunity to participate in the EECS 183 Showcase at the end of the semester, where my groupmates and I shared our work on making
    an automated player to a strategic game named <i>Elevators</i>. We were given a showcase award for our work, and I was further motivated to pursue a career in programming.</p>
    <p class="aboutMeText">Because I discovered my passion for programming in the second semester of my junior year, I started out a little behind my peers. This led me to fast-track my progress toward the Computer Science major, so I
    completed EECS 280: Programming and Intro Data Structures and EECS 203: Discrete Math (the introductory courses for UMich EECS) over the spring semester of 2024 and just recently completed EECS 281: Data Structures and Algorithms and EECS 376: Foundations of Computer Science during the semester of Fall 2024.
    I am now taking courses in web systems, user interface development, and computer organization for the Winter 2025 semester, which will allow me to graduate in the
    Fall of 2025.</p>
    <p class="aboutMeText">I am hoping to participate in an internship during the summer of 2025, and I am actively seeking positions.
    <br>I can be contacted at chriada(at)umich(dot)edu
    <br>Thank you!</p>

      <b>Asteroids Game</b><br>
        <p class="courseAndProjectParagraphs">A simple single-player game done for EECS 493: User Interface Development. I'm unfortunately unable to share my code publicly in order to make it playable for my website's visitors, but please enjoy the above clip showing some of the game's functions! Please note, some starter code was provided for this project, 90% of which aided with asteroid spawning/movement. The rest of the project's functions were programmed by me! The video does not have sound.</p>

          <p class="newsletterParagraph">I was the Global Awareness Project (GAP) Committee Chair for She's the First (STF) at Michigan, the University of Michigan's student organized chapter of the larger organization She's the First, for the 2023-2024 academic year. As GAP chair, I put together two semester newsletters featuring articles written by some of the club's members along with the occasional art pieces by some of our members. I used the occasional Canva template as a base, but about half of the pages are my own work. Pages two through five are my own designs, and the rest of the pages alternate between my own designs and designs that used Canva templates that I modified (to varying degrees). Please note that pages 15-17 are an art piece by another STF at UMich member and are not my own work.</p>
